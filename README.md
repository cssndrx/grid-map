Hey Nate! This is a clone of an existing data visualization, so go ahead and modify it as much as you like.

- Double click index.html to preview the site you have so far
- Running `python generate_drawdown_js.py` creates the Project Drawdown categorization - (@Nate: you'll need to come up with your own categorization for Grid projects, so you can replace it with your own thing)
- Running `python generate_mapping_js.py` takes a Google sheet and generates the JSON for putting each company into a category (you'll probably want something similar to this, but pulling from your Airtable instead of the Google sheet)
